# Survey
This is a brief overview what I learned from doing surveys while I was head of interaction design at Schule für Gestaltung in Zurich

## Give the option
Asking a question implies also possible outcomes of an answer. No matter what  assumptions were made for the Questionnaire – the pattern should be possible to be broken.

## Be kind
Some people tend to be kind and don’t give meaningful feedback if the answers are forthright:

## Problematic
Lessons I didn’t  like today:
* [ ] Interaction Design (morning)
* [ ] Motion Design (afternoon)

## Better
Lessons I would like to spend more time:
* [ ] Interaction Design (morning)

## It’s not black and white
Asking a specific question should allow for granular scale to get more accurate answers reflecting the real intention of the person.

* [ ] Yes
* [ ] No

I like Interaction Design a lot:
* [ ] entirely true
* [ ] mostly  true
